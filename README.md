# IPViewer
A simple Chrome Extension that shows the <b>IPv4 Address</b> and the remote server <b>location</b> of a webpage you are visiting. 

# Instructions
Since it is not available on Google Store, you will need to clone the project and install it by yourself through the unpacked extension button in the Google Chrome Extension Manager

Clone the project into your terminal
<pre>
  git clone https://github.com/Raffabello/IPViewer.git
</pre>

In Google Chrome go on
<pre>
  chrome://extensions/
</pre>

Load the Chrome extension. Surf any webpage, click on the extension icon, and you can now see the Webpage IP and Server location.

# Notes

It is a simple application that I developed for fun and to learn about Chrome Extensions. It serves more as a project for personal development than something that the public would find helpful.
Yet, it is a great tool to get IP and Location, easily without bothering to check the Server Response headers or go through APIs.
